Test Analysis for Dev's

If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking - George S. Patten

Why do Dev's struggle with test analysis?

- Think about the impact less than the implementation
- Simplify complex problems
- Think about the happy path
- Can think localised not big picture

What strengths do Dev's bring to test analysis?

- Code base knowledge
-- What consumes/interfaces with what
-- What code is new/old and risky
- Technical limits and constraints
- Knowledge of lower level testing

What is test analysis anyway?

- A set of heuristics/guides
- Used to sharpen the mind
- Generate ideas which may influence the development
- A conversation

What is not?

- An absolute set of instructions
- Complete
- Test plans, scripts, artefacts, its an approach
- The real tests will emerge over time

So, what shall we do?

- Look at some tools to widen out thinking
- Then create pragmatic analysis which informs implementation 

Lesson Plan

- Three's please
- Bit of variation

Stage 0 - Give me an example...

- If we have a live one, great.
- If not, a recent one is cool

Stage 1 - Brainstorm! (5 mins)

- Using these as a guide
- Pick a mnemonic from the handout
- Pick part of a mnenomic
- Add some if you want

Stage 2 - Setting a Mission (5 mins)

- What the testing is primarily concerned with
- We want to test, investigate, evaluate
- We don't want to prove, ensure, guarantee
- Encourages choice, communicating that we can't test everything
- One sentence, not much to ask?

Stage 3 - 5 Risks (10 mins)

- Come up with 5 risks - based around the mission
- You have to push your mind to get to 5
- Its too easy to give up, the idea is to stretch
- If they become trivial and/or vague then you might be at the edge

Stage 4 - Set your sessions (15 mins)

- This is the what and the how meeting the why
- Charters are one way to express the how and what to test...

Explore X
Using Y
To Discover Z

- Helps us to think about:
-- What data we need
-- What tooling might be useful
-- What types of techniques we can use
- Address the risks identified with your sessions

Stage 5 - Reflect (5 mins)

- One person present back please.
