### _Test Analysis for Developers_

__Description of Workshop__

Before implementation on a story or feature begins, wouldn't it be amazing if your devs could sort some coherent analysis of what might need testing? While I advocate testers spending more time on the left, it isn't always possible. Lets try and give some analytical guidance to our lovely, helpful devs. 

This workshop encourages developers to go beyond thinking about testing of the implementation only when considering test approach, branching out to risk and therefore impact on those who matter. Please make sure to advocate that some of this can be applied some of the time. Dependent on context. Pesky context.

The workshop requires:
* A0 Paper or Large Writable Wall Spaces
* Post It Notes
* Your favourite pens
* Or a laptop per team - I prefer the pens and paper 
* Scales to about 2 teams per facilitator 
* About 4 people per team works well
* Effort
* Questions
* Within the root folder, there is a handouts folder. Print one each.

__Objectives for this workshop:__

* `Attendees can recognise and explain the value of risk discovery when starting test analysis.`
* `Attendees can recognise and explain the value of setting a mission for testing, based on those risks.`
* `Attendees can select an appropriate mnemonic for a particular purpose to create test ideas.`
* `Attendees can explain the concept of charters, and create them to address risks using generated test ideas.`
* `Attendees are aware that

__Running Order__

`Please allow between 2 and 4 hours for this workshop, depending on:`
* `Knowledge of testing and thinking about risk`
* `How well they know each other`

__Exercise Breakdown__

* Intro - Why devs can be bad at test analysis, why they bring a unique perspective. What it is, what it aint.
* Stage 0 - split them into groups, and select a real example that they are working on as our subject. Real examples, no 'ecommerce checkouts.' (10-20 mins)
* Stage 1 - Get 10 risks out of them, stretch their minds, don't give in after 5. 6 and 7 might be daft, but 8, 9 and 10 might not be... (20-30 mins)
* Stage 2 - Mission for the testing, make them choose, pick up on AND/OR/BUT. One sentence, that might take a while (20-30 mins)
* Stage 3 - Pick a mnemonic - use the mnemonic crib sheet (handouts/testingmnemonics1.pdf) by Del Dewar (@deefex), attendees pick whichever the think is most appropriate and brainstorm ideas. (40-60mins)
* Stage 4 - Charters - demonstrate what good, bad, indifferent looks like with the handout (handouts/sessioncharterexamples1.pdf). Get the attendees to have a go, address a risk with each, and incorporate test ideas into them from the mnemonic test idea part. (40-60 mins).
* Conclusion - Remind, its a toolkit, not a process. You can do less based on the change. Give them Hendrickson's Test Heuristic Cheat Sheet (handouts/testheuristicscheatsheetv1.pdf) - because it rocks.

__About Me__

I'm a continuously learning tester with a penchant for getting involved in all aspects of developing people and products. I used to be a fully fledged consultant with The Test People, veteran of various engagements encompassing testing, performance engineering and automation. Now I'm in the start up world, heavily involved in mobile product development, from the ground up. I also speak, coach and contribute to the local tech community in Leeds. I'm quite busy but always have time for a question, usually answered with another question. I have a blog at http://testingisbelieving.blogspot.co.uk/ too, oh and I tweet from @northern_tester. :-)
